# Transformer-based Sequential Recommendation

This is the research project `"Exploring Temporal Factors in Transformer-based Recommendation Systems for Sequential Recommendation"` for COMP 5331, which focuses on Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

## Inspiration

Our work and code is inspired by the KDD 2023 paper [Text Is All You Need: Learning Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13731) and [Recformer](https://github.com/JiachengLi1995/Recformer) implementation.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.10
- PyTorch 2.0.0
- PyTorch Lightning 2.0.0
- Transformers 4.28.0
- Deepspeed 0.9.0

## Pretrained Model
Download the pretrained model from the following links and put them in the `./pretrained_model` folder.

## Zero-shot
### Dataset
We use several categories in [Amazon dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/) to evaluate the zero-shot recommendation performance.

You can process the raw data using our provided scripts `process_data/process.py`. You need to set meta data path `--meta_file_path`, interaction data path `--file_path`, output path `--output_path`, and `--sample_rate` (the default value is 1) in `process_data/process.sh`, and execute the script:
```bash
cd process_data
bash process.sh
```
### Evaluation
You can evaluate the zero-shot recommendation performance using our provided scripts `zero_shot.py`. You need to set the model path `--model_ckpt` and the dataset path `--dataset_path` in `zero_shot.sh` and execute the script:
```bash
bash zero_shot.sh
```
Our code will evaluate the zero-shot recommendation performance of the given model on the dataset and return the following metrics:
- NDGC@10, NDGC@50
- Recall@10, Recall@50
- MRR
- AUC

## Finetuning
### Dataset
We use several categories in [Amazon dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/) to finetune our model.

You can process the raw data using our provided scripts `process_data/process.py`. You need to set meta data path `--meta_file_path`, interaction data path `--file_path`, output path `--output_path`, and `--sample_rate` (the default value is 1) in `process_data/process.sh`, and execute the script:
```bash
cd process_data
bash process.sh
```
### Training
You can finetune our model using our provided scripts `finetune.py`. In `finetune.sh`, you need to set the model path `--pretrain_ckpt`, the dataset path `--data_path`, and you can also set the maximum nunber of training epoch `--num_train_epochs`. To load the best item embedding table from stage 1 before getting into stage 2 of training, set `--reload_item_embeddings` to `True`, otherwise set it to `False`. You can execute the script by:
```bash
bash finetune.sh
```
Our code will finetune the pretrained model on the dataset and save the finetuned model and the evaluation results in the `./checkpoints` folder.
